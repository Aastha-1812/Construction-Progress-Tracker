Developed a role-based Construction Progress Tracker mobile application to streamline project monitoring and communication among Admins, Managers, and Workers. The application enables admins to assign projects to managers, managers to allocate workers, and workers to report on-site issues in real time. Workers can also raise complaints directly against managers, which are visible to the admin for transparency and accountability.

Managers can analyze worker-reported issues through interactive pie charts and detailed visual reports, and submit project progress updates—including photos and videos captured via camera or gallery—to the admin. The admin dashboard offers centralized control with project status management (including disabling completed projects), complaint monitoring, and real-time weather updates to support informed decision-making.

The application is designed with an offline-first architecture, ensuring usability in low or no network conditions, and syncs data automatically when connectivity is restored. It incorporates efficient state management and background processing to enhance performance, responsiveness, and scalability. The system supports multilingual functionality, with English and Spanish languages available, improving accessibility for a diverse workforce.

This solution improves collaboration, transparency, and operational efficiency in construction project management.
